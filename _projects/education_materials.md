One of SPILab's goals is increasing awareness around privacy issues among the general public, so that people understand what are the privacy risks exist and also are able to take actions to safeguard their privacy online.

To this end, SPILab has hosted numerous workshops, teach-ins, and 'Privacy Clinics' aimed at educating the general public around privacy issues in today's digital age. Some are tailored to specific populations, such as workshops aimed at older adults. Others are aimed at more general audiences.

For these events, we have created numerous handouts and materials to aid in teaching on various privacy issues. Feel free to browse the materials below and use them!
