### Bio

Jane is a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information and Computer Science & Engineering. She is co-advised by Dr. Florian Schaub and Dr. Nikola Banovic. Jane's research agenda is on designing social systems grounded in affirmative consent to tackle problems both in the user-to-system (user-to-company) context (e.g., privacy issues) and user-to-user context (e.g., online harassment).

In general, Jane's research interests are at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, Privacy, Feminist Studies, and Business Management. She likes interdisciplinary work and mixed methods.
